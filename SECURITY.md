# Security Policy

## End User Policy

To ASCOM Alpaca standard is not secure. It is open by design. Simply stated, Alpaca and network security are separate things. Only use within an isolated protected virtual or local network.

## Development Policy

The open ASCOM Alpaca design is no excuse for the software security vulnerabilities or bad design. Anyone working on the Alpaca Benro Polaris project needs awareness of modern secure design practices. All enhancements, fixes, and changes need to be made securely.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. 

If you identify any security vulnerability inconsistent with the ASCOM Alpaca standard, please report it, promptly. 
You can report a vulnerability as an issue on this project or to David Morrison at jdmorriso@gmail.com.
