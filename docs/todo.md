# Beta Testing
## Beta Testing Guidelines
* Document the environment you use to test - equipment, software, versions.
* Try to perform real world use case tests as well as load and performance tests.
* Keep a record of what tests you perform and the results
* Report any issues noticed as issues in Github
* Try to reproduce and document steps to reproduce, isolate what is causing the issue, diagnose yourself if you can.
* Test the documentation where possible, if its missing help author or improve them.
* Confirm you will send a final summary of Beta testing feedback to me by 17 Sep, so we have time to address any issues.
* Confirm you will not share any pre-release code or docs with others.
