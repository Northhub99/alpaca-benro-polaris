Omar Badman Salam Yes, we've probably had more testing on MacOS than Win11. Unfortunately, Nina doesn't work on MacOS, but some Beta testers have used CCDceil instead. I personally think its worth getting a miniPC for Nina. But if you just want to use StellariumPLUS, there's no need. Just use your iPhone or Android and keep using BP App for image capture.

My question is, what kind of performance can I expect from Polaris, have tried it only up to 50mm lenses and works great as is up to a minute of exposure
Can I track at 500mm for example?

Aykut Argun It's hard to comment on this as it may depend on your equipment and temperament 🙂. I've succeeded with 800mm and exposures of up to 15 seconds. I created an hour-long stacked exposure with a powerful desktop and around 240 images. The keeper rate was high. Vladimir has taken images at 1750mm equivalent focal length!!! Using a ZWO ASI585MC camera, a Sigma 120-400mm, and a 1.4x extender. Exposures of 15s up to around 100 images stacked. He's setting the record.
From my experience, the BP struggles with longer exposers at longer focal lengths. This may not be a hardware issue, as I've instrumented the driver with some data logging features to track the AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) and I'm impressed with its results.
I'm tossing about whether to do another video on describing how to use the driver to your own performance measurements and analysis. Depends on feedback whether I'll do it.

David Morrison Thanks for the comments. It sounds like these features are extremely exciting for people that have been in the deep sky branch for a while.
I think it would be super nice to have a summary for those who want somewhat better tracking performance in longer focal lengths, but will have the least hassle possible. I have a quite technical background (Ph.D in Physics and working as an ML developer), but I still have difficulty following these videos.
What I mean to tell is, that most people who bought Polaris have a completely different expectation of user experience than the workflows presented in these videos. Even the original Polaris app is too complicated for an average user that sooo many people can't even get it to do a tracked panorama (which I think Polaris does an outstanding job already).
Big thanks for putting in all the work, I really appreciate and admire the work done here, absolutely do not wanna be misunderstood as a whiny dude. Just trying to give feedback for the most use of the improvements for the average user.

Stephen Dyer I seem to recollect three star alignment and plate solving was mentioned hence I'm following this thread.
The additional software mentioned in the video could be helpful in the field if you didn't have a bhatinov mask to assist focusing (presumably via the mini hdmi port), though not everyone wants to lug a laptop or iPad with them, which is fine as it's personal preferences after all.

Stephen Dyer I’m getting great, not perfect, results with a setup using a 400mm lens and a x1.4 multiplier on a Astro camera with a small sensor resulting to more than 1700mm equivalent focal length. I’m limiting the shot duration to 15s, but anyway with the Astro camera at optimal gain going for longer shots would result in overexposed stars.

Bikram Ghosh This is a very good question, and thanks for the support. Intent is to keep it portable. In fact I'm heading to a dark zone tomorrow for 6 days and I'm taking my Benro.
ABP is being designed to work without the internet, even for plate solving. Admittedly, I will take a laptop and operate it inside the hut. Outside will be a mini-pc hanging from the tripod, wifi to the BP, USB to the Camera. I'll remote desktop to the mini PC from my laptop. The nature of Nina and the other Astro Apps lends to a larger screen. Nina does have a web UI but I haven't tried it yet.
The driver follows the Alpaca/ASCOM standard, if anyone has an ASIAir I'd love to know if it can work with it, as I think it has a better mobile UI. Dont know if we can sneak the driver onto the ASIAir. 🙂
Another option some of the Beta testers have suggested is trying to run Nina and the driver from a Windows Surface tablet, untested, but could maybe work.

David Morrison hope your experiments are all going fine David. It's good to know that the portability is a priority.
One other thing came to my mind - the Polaris operates with an error tolerance if 9 Arc seconds if I'm not wrong. So there's a limitation on the hardware I assume, in terms of what focal length can successfully track on this mount. I think I have seen upto 200mm being successfully used. Do you think with the help of multi star alignment and NINA, a larger focal length of say 400mm or 500mm can be used. I guess even in that case there may be recalibration required after every so often. I could be imagining a lot here.

Plate solving would be awesome along with some form of scene correction that could correct for drift. Auto focus would be difficult and require additional hardware associated with the specifics of your camera, i.e. Electronic Auto Focuser. However it could measure and report star size. That said a Bahtinov mask is used even on systems with AF. So Plate Solving would be a great start.

Hey Dave- I am super enthusiastic about your effort as demonstrated by my 200 dollar donation to your kickstarter. I am unable to safely walk so must operate from inside car . I set it up with door open then back off a little. Obviously magnetic errors are sky high. Results are random although sometimes I can get reasonable pointing by getting it pointed to the celestial alignment object. Results are not consistent however. I have tried to point toward true north then level and point compass to north when Polaris was level and aligned to true north in azimuth then calibrating and confirming compass. No joy there. Anyway looking forward to results . Thanks for efforts.

Mark Bahu Hi Mark, thanks so much for your support. If you don't mind tinkering around with a mini-pc, then I think this will help you. Having the mini-PC next to the Benro gives you a better hotspot to connect to and lets you more easily slew remotely. Also, sometimes when I point my camera with an 800mm lens I have no idea where it's pointing. Last night I tried the plate solving and I was impressed. Nina quickly identified where I was pointing, worked out how to fix it, slewed the BP to the correct spot, rechecked and centered it spot on 🙂.

I went out today and tried following the Benro video for Astro setup . Made sure mount was level then followed their procedure step by step. Had large pointing error to sun but corrected by celestial object alignment. If I could control with other software which could plate solve that would be fantastic. As I am handicapped can’t put vehicle 20 yards away during initial compass cal . Anyway thanks and looking forward to solutions.

I’m also using the Polaris for astrophotography and my main concerns are the quality of alignment and drifting.

And the drifting is also a pain because the target is quite quickly going out of the frame…

John Harrison In Pix using WBPP you have it plate solve each sub anyway or if you already have a stacked and or cropped image you can use image solver to do that. Not discounting your suggestion just Pix already does that. When I do raw files, .arw, Pix has no issues.

It's one of those WBPP takes ages and because I shoot alot of wide stuff (45mm) image solver isn't great with finding targets in the image.
I am practicing on a 2 image mosaic of orion/california/pleaides at the moment and I ended up using stelarium to identify a bright star in the middle of the image and use that for a partial solve.
I've seen people copy and paste their cords from a fits on to an image to attach astrometic data. Just thinking this could be useful, especially since alot of people shoot wide, assuming there isn't an easier way of doing it

John Harrison Try the Script under Image Analysis - Image Solver, very fast on a completed stack and writes the coordinates to the image. Helps if you give it a place to start, i.e. M42. Takes 15 seconds or so. I have to do this after cropping, regardless if WBPP solved during the stack. But you have a good suggestion.

Would it be worth asking Benro for backing ? (kickstarter or otherwise) as you point out, their own product development has slowed down (in favour of the Theta self leveling tripod).
They may be keen to back the end use you are developing as it improves their product.
Just make damn sure you retain the IP rights or get royalties from all sales of the Polaris head!
I backed the Polaris and have one of the founder models but I didn’t back the Theta, due to the slow down with Polaris.

One thing I'll add is if you're going down the astrophotography route ie plate solving and 3 star alignment maybe put the auto focus down to 3rd since shouldn't be using AF when picturing the stars.
But saying that there is a lot more functionality than just stars.

Fraser Harrison thanks for your kind words. The af is Nina’s and Hocus Focus magic. It drives the focus of your lens, takes a picture, determines the average star width, then moves again. After 12 or so images it fits a hyperbolic curve and moves your lens to optimal focus. You need a lens/camera supported by ascom. I have a canon r5 and it does a better job at focusing than Canons own L lens af. It’s really cool.

Toby Lo: It looks like SkySafari 7 Plus and SkySafari 7 Pro iOS both support the Alpaca protocol, so these should work directly with the Alpaca Benro Polaris. Any Beta testers for SkySafari would be most welcome.
Everyone else, this post has enough support for me to add SynScan protocol support. This will allow MacOS, Android, and Apple phones/iPad users to use Stellarium PLUS. It will enable GOTO, MOVE, Live RETICLE, Time SYNC, Location SYNC, and Position SYNC with the driver.
Having SynSCAN protocol may also allow us to support guiding - if only we can get Benro to allow Move during sidereal tracking without the Backlash dance, and improve the responsiveness.

Craig Shepherd, please direct message me your GitHub username (create one if you don’t have one) and confirm you are ok with beta test guidelines. Once I get these, I’ll add access for you.

I think for a long run it might be worth it.
In the end - tablet (iPad) is much easier to carry or manage than a laptop.

I'm far more likely to lug around my iPad. I think this is a great idea.

Sounds great but it needs to be with improvements to pointing accuracy through 2 star or multi star alignment.

Does this mean that you’d be able to pick a target in Stellarium and the BP would position for it? If so, yes that would be great.

not me. Polaris is 95 percent used for just Milky Way

Sounds like an excellent idea - SynScan can also be used on an iPhone, which is what I used when I had a SW Star Adventurer GTi .... so it could be even better to use with a larger screen version of the iPhone (Max Pro etc) or an iPad mini, rather than carrying a full sized iPad. The SWSA GTi is a GoTo equatorial mount and the SynScan app offers the 1, 2 and 3 star alignment options - which would be fantastic if it could be incorporated into the new functionality for the Benro Polaris (controlled via SynScan) and at last, deliver the 2 and 3 star alignment we have all been waiting for. Of course, it might be a complex challenge incorporate into the BP😀😀

I would like to see Sky Safari/Celestron Sky Portal support rather than Stellarium.
