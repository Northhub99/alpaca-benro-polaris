# Using Stellarium with Benro Polaris
### To slew to Co-ordinates from Stellarium
The next step is to check the Wifi on the Benro Polaris (blue LED should be on).
Also ensure it is in Astro mode and has already been aligned with the App.
Finally ensure the AAPB driver is running and connected to Polaris Wifi. 

Once this is done, you can now control the mount from Stellarium
1. Select an object in Stellarium
2. Press `Ctrl+0`, to open Telescope Slew control.
3. Click `Current Object`
4. Click `Slew`.

Yeah, no more manually entering RA/Dec coordinates into the Benro Polaris App.
