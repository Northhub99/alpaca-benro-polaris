# Benro Sponsorship

## Original outreach email (2-Sep-2024)
To support@benro.com,

Thank you for releasing the fantastic Benro Polaris tripod head product. It is the best travel astro mount you can buy worldwide - lightweight, sturdy, high precision, and well-designed.

I have started a community project based on user feedback from the Facebook Polaris Camera Controller Global Group. The project aims to allow a wider suite of astrophotography applications to be compatible with the Bennro Polaris. Please refer to the following link for more information -  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jdmorriso/alpaca-benro-polaris-driver. I aim to release this project on GitHub in October 2024. The project has received extensive encouragement from the Facebook group and is well on track to make its release date.

This email is to check whether Benro's leadership can support the project. I'm not asking for any pledge (although anything would help). More so, I'm asking for Benro Leadership's project acknowledgment and approval. 
From a technical perspective, I would appreciate it if the Benro Design team could consider this community project's compatibility when making future changes to the firmware or application. If we are notified of any protocol changes, we can maintain compatibility, proactively. 

Finally, we would welcome a representative from Benro to join the Design team on GitHub. We welcome any design review, feedback, or contributions to ensure the driver controls the  Benro Polaris as intended.

Based on the enthusiasm from the Kickstart project and Facebook group, this project can grow Benro Polaris sales and user engagement.    

Thank you for your time and support.

Best Regards

David Morrison
