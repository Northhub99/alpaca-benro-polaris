# Benro Sponsorship

## Original outreach email (2-Sep-2024)
To support@benro.com,

Thank you for releasing the fantastic Benro Polaris tripod head product. It is the best travel astro mount you can buy worldwide - lightweight, sturdy, high precision, and well-designed.

I have started a community project based on user feedback from the Facebook Polaris Camera Controller Global Group. The project aims to allow a wider suite of astrophotography applications to be compatible with the Bennro Polaris. Please refer to the following link for more information -  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jdmorriso/alpaca-benro-polaris-driver. I aim to release this project on GitHub in October 2024. The project has received extensive encouragement from the Facebook group and is well on track to make its release date.

This email is to check whether Benro's leadership can support the project. I'm not asking for any pledge (although anything would help). More so, I'm asking for Benro Leadership's project acknowledgment and approval. 
From a technical perspective, I would appreciate it if the Benro Design team could consider this community project's compatibility when making future changes to the firmware or application. If we are notified of any protocol changes, we can maintain compatibility, proactively. 

Finally, we would welcome a representative from Benro to join the Design team on GitHub. We welcome any design review, feedback, or contributions to ensure the driver controls the  Benro Polaris as intended.

Based on the enthusiasm from the Kickstart project and Facebook group, this project can grow Benro Polaris sales and user engagement.    

Thank you for your time and support.

Best Regards
David Morrison

## Followup correspondance (16-Sep-2024)
To support@benro.com,
This is a follow-up to my request for support on the Alpaca Benro Polaris Project. 

The project has continued to gain support across the user community and has transitioned into a beta testing phase. It is feature-complete, and the remaining work focuses on QA, performance, and stability. The project will be released as open-source in less than two weeks. 

Please let me know if you have a technical representative to review the work before its release. Also, let me know if you have any requirements or changes you would like to make to the project before it becomes public.

Best Regards
David Morrison

Dear Sir/Madam,

Thanks for contacting us! 

Our team will leave the office for Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival from 15th September to 17th September, and we will get back on 18th September. No worries, we will answer the email as soon as we come back. Thanks for your understanding! 

Wish you have a nice day!

Best regards,
The Benro Team

## Final Call for involvement (25-Sep-2024)
Dear Benro Support,
I want to thank Benro Leadership again for releasing the excellent Benro Polaris Tripod Head. I've been more impressed with its design and quality as I have learned more about its performance and behavior. I also want to thank Benro Leadership for monitoring the Alpaca Benro Polaris Project and not attempting to halt or prevent its release. 

This is the last-chance call for a review of the project before I release it on September 29th, 2024. I am still willing to add access to the GitHub repository for a Benro Technical Representative to review and request changes before the release. If you want to do this, please reply with a GitHub user account name as soon as possible.

Best Regards
David Morrison
