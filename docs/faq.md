# Benro Polaris Capability Questions

### Can the Benro Polaris really be used for Deep Sky Photography?
Yes. As an Alt/Az Mount and no guiding you will be limited to relatively short exposures. But with a good camera, an 800mm lens, ABP, Nina and Siril you can take some great photos of Deep Sky objects.

### What is the longest Focal Length that Benro Polaris can track with?
I've succeeded with 800mm and exposures of up to 15 seconds. I created an hour-long stacked exposure with a powerful desktop and around 240 images. The keeper rate was high. 

Valdimir has taken images at 1750mm equivalent focal length, using a ZWO ASI585MC camera, a Sigma 120-400mm and 1.4x extender. Exposures of 15s up to around 100 images stacked. Great results.

# Alpaca and Nina Capability Questions
### Can Nina generate a file with the coordinates associated with each image?
Nina includes a plug-in called Session Manager that can record this and so much more into a set of csv files

### Is auto-guiding going to be possible?
I'm sorry, but auto-guiding is unlikely. Drift of long sequences can be fixed with ABP, Nina, and slew/center.

# Alpaca Usage Questions
### Can I use the Driver on my Mobile Device?
The driver needs to be installed on a device that (a) supports Python and (b) can connect to the Benro Polaris wifi Network. Initially, we are exploring a Laptop, mini-PC, Raspberry Pi, and MacOS. We will provide guidelines on what we have successfully tested and how to set them up.

### Can i use Nina on my Mobile Device?
Nina is a Windows application that best runs on a desktop, laptop, or mini PC. It can be operated remotely using Remote Desktop. There are Remote Desktop apps for both Android and Apple Mobile platforms. So, it will be possible to use Nina from a phone, but the user experience is not ideal.
